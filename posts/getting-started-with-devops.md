DevOps is not just a tool or a technology — it's a **mindset** and a **culture** that unifies software development (**Dev**) and IT operations (**Ops**). It’s all about collaboration, automation, and rapid delivery.

## 🚀 What is DevOps?

DevOps is a combination of:

- **Development**: Writing and testing code.
- **Operations**: Deploying, monitoring, and maintaining applications.

The goal of DevOps is to reduce the software development lifecycle and ensure high software quality by **automating and integrating** the work of both teams.

## 🧩 Core Principles of DevOps

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
   Frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing.

2. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**  
   Automatically deploying all code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage.

3. **Automation**  
   Automating manual tasks like testing, building, and deployment to improve speed and reduce errors.

4. **Monitoring & Feedback**  
   Continuously monitoring applications and infrastructure to detect issues and improve performance.

5. **Collaboration & Communication**  
   Encouraging better teamwork between developers and operations teams.

## 🔧 Key Tools in DevOps

| Category              | Tools                      |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Source Control        | Git, GitHub, GitLab        |
| CI/CD Pipelines       | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI |
| Containerization      | Docker                     |
| Orchestration         | Kubernetes                 |
| Configuration Management | Ansible, Chef, Puppet     |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | Terraform, AWS CloudFormation |
| Monitoring & Logging  | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack |
| Cloud Providers       | AWS, Azure, GCP            |

## 📦 Example DevOps Workflow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions triggers a workflow.
3. Workflow runs tests and builds the app.
4. If successful, the app is containerized using Docker.
5. Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub.
6. Image is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
7. Monitoring tools watch the deployment in real-time.
