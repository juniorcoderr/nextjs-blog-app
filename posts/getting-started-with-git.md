Version control is one of the most important skills a developer can have, and **Git** and **GitHub** make it easier than ever to manage your projects and collaborate with others.

In this guide, we’ll explore what Git and GitHub are, how they work, and how to get started using them in your own projects.

---

## 🚀 What is Git?

**Git** is a **distributed version control system** that helps you track changes in your code over time.

It allows you to:

- Save different versions of your project
- Revert back to previous versions
- Work on new features without affecting your main code
- Collaborate with other developers

Think of it as a **time machine** for your code.

---

## 🐙 What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts your Git repositories online.

With GitHub, you can:

- Backup your projects
- Collaborate with others
- Open-source your code
- Showcase your portfolio
- Track issues and changes

## 🛠️ Common Git Commands

Here's a list of the most commonly used Git commands:

```bash
git init         # Initialize a new Git repository
git status       # Check current status
git add .        # Stage all files for commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"  # Commit changes
git log          # View commit history
git branch       # List or create branches
git checkout     # Switch branches
git merge        # Merge branches
git clone <repo> # Clone a repository
git push         # Push code to GitHub
git pull         # Pull latest changes from GitHub
```

---

## 🧑‍💻 Setting Up Git & GitHub

1. **Install Git**
   - Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
   - Run `git --version` to verify installation

2. **Configure Git**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   ```

3. **Create a Repository on GitHub**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com/)
   - Create a new repository
   - Copy the repo URL

4. **Connect Local Project to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repo-url>
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 🌱 Branching in Git

Branches allow you to work on new features without changing the main code.

```bash
git checkout -b feature-login
# work on code
git add .
git commit -m "Added login feature"
git checkout main
git merge feature-login
```

---

## 🔄 Pull Requests

When working in teams, GitHub pull requests let you:

- Review code before merging
- Discuss changes with team members
- Approve or request changes

This is essential for **collaborative development**.

---

## 📦 Bonus: .gitignore

Use a `.gitignore` file to **exclude files** from being tracked.

Example:
```
node_modules/
.env
.DS_Store
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Write clear commit messages
- Use branches for features or bugs
- Pull before you push
- Keep your commits small and meaningful
- Use `.gitignore` wisely

---

## 🔚 Conclusion

Git and GitHub are **essential tools** for every developer. Once you learn them, they become second nature — and your projects become easier to manage, collaborate on, and scale.

Whether you're building a personal project or contributing to open source, mastering version control will take you far. 🚀

Happy coding!
