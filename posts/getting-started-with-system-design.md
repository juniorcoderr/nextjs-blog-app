System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow for a software system. Whether you're building a simple web app or a complex distributed system like Netflix or Amazon, system design is key to scaling and reliability.

## 🧠 Why Learn System Design?

- 💼 Required in top tech interviews (FAANG and others)
- 📈 Helps build scalable and fault-tolerant applications
- 🧰 Strengthens your understanding of backend infrastructure
- 👥 Encourages better communication and planning in engineering teams

## 🧩 Core Concepts of System Design

### 1. **Scalability**
- **Vertical Scaling**: Upgrading machine resources (CPU, RAM).
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to handle load.

### 2. **Load Balancing**
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers.
- Tools: NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ELB.

### 3. **Caching**
- Stores frequently accessed data to reduce latency.
- Tools: Redis, Memcached.

### 4. **Database Design**
- Choosing between **SQL (relational)** and **NoSQL (non-relational)**.
- Database normalization, indexing, and sharding.

### 5. **Data Partitioning (Sharding)**
- Splits large datasets across multiple databases.

### 6. **Replication**
- Duplicating data to increase reliability and availability.

### 7. **Message Queues & Event-Driven Architecture**
- Helps in decoupling services and handling asynchronous tasks.
- Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SQS.

### 8. **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**
- Delivers static content from the nearest server to reduce latency.

## 🏗️ Components of a Modern System

- **Client (Browser, Mobile App)**
- **API Gateway**
- **Web Server**
- **Application Layer (Business Logic)**
- **Database Layer**
- **Cache Layer**
- **Load Balancer**
- **Queue (for async processing)**
- **Logging & Monitoring**

## 🧪 Example: Design a URL Shortener (like bit.ly)

1. **Requirements**:
   - Shorten a URL
   - Redirect to original URL
   - Track click analytics

2. **Components**:
   - API Service (to generate and fetch short URLs)
   - Database (to store mapping between short and long URLs)
   - Caching (to speed up redirects)
   - Analytics Module

3. **Database Schema**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE urls (
     short_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
     original_url TEXT NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

4. **Design Considerations**:
   - Ensure uniqueness of short URLs
   - Prevent abuse (rate limiting)
   - Scale reads with cache and load balancers

## 🧭 How to Approach a System Design Interview

1. **Clarify Requirements**  
   Functional and non-functional.

2. **Define High-Level Design**  
   Break down the system into major components.

3. **Drill into Each Component**  
   Talk about databases, APIs, caching, etc.

4. **Identify Bottlenecks & Tradeoffs**  
   Talk about pros and cons of each choice.

5. **Think About Scale, Security, and Maintenance**

## 🔥 Final Thoughts

System Design is a mix of **architecture, engineering intuition, and problem-solving**. Start with basics, practice with common interview problems, and grow by building projects that reflect real-world systems.

> *"Design systems that are not just functional, but scalable, reliable, and elegant."*
